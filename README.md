ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shourya Tyagi
---
Born and brought up in Faridabad, Haryana, India. I am constantly surrounded by Tech and fond of it. I started learning to program when I was in my high school and fell in love with it. Java is the language I adore. Trying to be better than yesterday is my motto. 
I am skilled at Java, JavaScript, C++, AndroidStudio. I created few android apps and pushed to my GitHub.
